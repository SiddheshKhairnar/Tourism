The citadel of the fort is located on the top of a hill.The Fort of Daulatabad has seen many dynasty’s fall and rise. Yadava King Bhillama V built it in the 11th century C.E. It was their capital until the end of the 13th century C.E. till AllauddinKhilji bought it under the Delhi Sultanate. The quick succession of political events led it under the Tughlaq.

          <p className='info1'>It was later on captured by NizamShahis of Ahmednagar in 1499 C.E. and was made as their capital in 1607 C.E. After a prolonged siege of around four months it was successfully captured by the Mughals. For a short period, this was under the Maratha Empire. It was then captured by the Nizams of Hyderabad, who took over the fort around 1724 CE and handed over the fort to the government of India after Independence.
            The fort is unique. The artisans have chiselled out the hill of the citadel to make it undefeatable. The fort was surrounded by a moat. The approach road to the citadel is through a tunnel in the same hillock. This makes the fort virtually unapproachable. This rock-cut tunnel was made during the Yadava period in the 11th century CE. There are numerous bastions in the fortification walls. Many ruins of palace-like structures, temples and public buildings are found in the surrounding area. </p>
