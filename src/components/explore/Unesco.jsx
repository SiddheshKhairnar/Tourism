          <p className='info'>On an island a few kilometres off the Gateway of India, you'll find a City of Caves with an impressive display of Indian architecture dating back to the 2nd century. The small island hides many archaeological remains that showcase the rich culture of the area. While the caves were damaged over the centuries, there was an effort to restore them in the 1970s which led to its declaration as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. </p>
           <p className='info1'>Visiting the caves is an experience in itself as you enjoy the scenic ferry ride from the Gateway of India to reach the island. Once you're here, you must explore Cave 1 that displays a 7-foot Sadashiva statue and the Trimurti at its entrance, both of which are considered an architectural masterpiece. Exploring the island thoroughly can take a couple of hours so it's best to plan your visit early in the day and spend time here at leisure.</p>
